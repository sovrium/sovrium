# Sovrium Docs Site

> A docs website from markdown — a Docusaurus alternative.

Built with [Sovrium](https://sovrium.com) — a configuration-as-code interpreter: one config
file in, a complete self-hosted web application out.

## Use this template

Click **Use this template** on GitHub to copy this app into your own repository (clean
history, yours to modify), or scaffold it locally:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://sovrium.com/install | sh
sovrium init my-docs-site --template docs-site
```

## What's inside

Markdown files under `content/docs/` become one route per file with a grouped sidebar, prev/next, a TOC, and Shiki code blocks.

Everything is declared in [`app.yaml`](./app.yaml) and the [`config/`](./config) tree —
no application code. Edit the config, restart, done.

## Run locally

```bash
sovrium start app.yaml
```

Zero-config: embedded SQLite, local file storage, no env vars required to boot. See
[`.env.example`](./.env.example) for the optional variables (database, auth bootstrap,
email, AI).

## Deploy

The **Deploy on Scalingo** button above provisions the app with a PostgreSQL addon
(Scalingo's filesystem is ephemeral — the database keeps your data across deploys; file
uploads are stored in Postgres too). Secrets are generated automatically; you only fill in
`BASE_URL`. Any other host works the same way: run the `sovrium` binary with this config
(see [DEPLOY.md](https://github.com/sovrium/sovrium/blob/main/DEPLOY.md)).
