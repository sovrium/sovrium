### Terms

The Licensor hereby grants you the right to copy, modify, create derivative works, redistribute, and make non-production use of the Licensed Work. The Licensor may make an Additional Use Grant, above, permitting limited production use.

Effective on the Change Date, or the fourth anniversary of the first publicly available distribution of a specific version of the Licensed Work under this License, whichever comes first, the Licensor hereby grants you rights under the terms of the Change License, and the rights granted in the paragraph above terminate.

If your use of the Licensed Work does not comply with the requirements currently in effect as described in this License, you must purchase a commercial license from the Licensor, its affiliated entities, or authorized resellers, or you must refrain from using the Licensed Work.

All copies of the original and modified Licensed Work, and derivative works of the Licensed Work, are subject to this License. This License applies separately for each version of the Licensed Work and the Change Date may vary for each version of the Licensed Work released by Licensor.

You must conspicuously display this License on each original or modified copy of the Licensed Work. If you receive the Licensed Work in original or modified form from a third party, the terms and conditions set forth in this License apply to your use of that work.

Any use of the Licensed Work in violation of this License will automatically terminate your rights under this License for the current and all other versions of the Licensed Work.

This License does not grant you any right in any trademark or logo of Licensor or its affiliates (provided that you may use a trademark or logo of Licensor as expressly required by this License).

TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE LICENSED WORK IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS. LICENSOR HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING (WITHOUT LIMITATION) WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND TITLE.

"You" refers to the individual or legal entity exercising rights under this License.

"Your company" means any legal entity, sole proprietorship, or other kind of organization that you work for, plus all organizations that have control over, are under the control of, or are under common control with that organization. "Control" means ownership of substantially all the assets of an entity, or the power to direct its management and policies by vote, contract, or otherwise. Control can be direct or indirect.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I use Sovrium for free?

**Yes**, for internal business use, personal projects, educational purposes, and non-competing client deployments. See the Additional Use Grant above for details.

### Can I modify and redistribute Sovrium?

**Yes**, as long as:
1. You comply with the Additional Use Grant restrictions
2. You include this License with all copies
3. You conspicuously mark any modifications you make

### Can I offer Sovrium as a hosted service to my customers?

**No**, not under this License. That use case requires a separate commercial license. Contact **license@sovrium.com** for commercial licensing.

### When does Sovrium become fully open source?

On **January 1, 2029** (or 4 years after v1.0.0 release, whichever comes first), Sovrium automatically converts to **Apache License 2.0**. After that date, all restrictions are lifted.

### Can I fork Sovrium and compete with it?

You can fork Sovrium for **non-competing purposes**. If your fork becomes a commercial hosted service competing with Sovrium, you need a commercial license or must wait until the Change Date (2029-01-01).

### What if I'm already using Sovrium when the license changes?

Your existing deployment continues to work. When Sovrium becomes Apache 2.0, you get **more** rights, not fewer.

### How do I get a commercial license?

Contact **license@sovrium.com** with details about your use case. We offer flexible licensing for:
- Managed hosting providers
- SaaS platforms embedding Sovrium
- OEM/white-label redistributors
- Organizations needing custom terms
