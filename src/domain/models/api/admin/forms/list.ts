/**
 * API contract for `GET /api/admin/forms` and the sibling detail endpoint
 * `GET /api/admin/forms/:formName`.
 *
 * **The first non-keystone consumer of `createAdminListEndpoint`.**
 *
 * Where `US-ADMIN-AUTOMATIONS-RUNS-LIST` (story #3) authored the helper
 * against a DB-backed list (`automation_runs`), this story is the canary:
 * if the helper API generalizes to a config-backed list (rows come from
 * the in-memory `app.forms[]` array, not from a runtime-mutated DB table),
 * subsequent stories #5–#7 ship without helper changes. If forms-list
 * needs a helper field that the helper does not surface, that's a P0
 * blocker per plan §3.5 (additivity-only across stories #3–#7).
 *
 * **Three ADR-012 decisions are CONSUMED here, not locked**:
 *
 * - **D2 (consumed)** — `?include_deleted=false` is the default;
 *   `?include_deleted=true` is the opt-in. Forms are config-time entities
 *   (defined in `app.forms[]`, not stored in a runtime-mutated table) so
 *   the parameter is a forward contract — same behavior as runs-list.
 * - **D3 (consumed)** — every item carries the canonical `_admin: {
 *   auditTrailCount, lastModifiedBy, deletedAt, metadata? }` block from
 *   `_shared/admin-envelope.ts`. Forms-list is the FIRST consumer to
 *   populate `_admin.metadata` (with `fieldCount`, `submissionCount`,
 *   `lastSubmissionAt`) — proves the canonical block stays stable while
 *   domain-specific extras flow through the optional escape hatch.
 * - **D9 (consumed)** — runtime handler MUST consume
 *   `createAdminListEndpoint`. NO new helper field is authored here.
 *
 * **Schema-drift mitigation** (plan §6.5): the public `formSummarySchema`
 * from `src/domain/models/api/forms/forms.ts` is the canonical source of
 * truth for the form summary shape. This admin module **extends** it with
 * the `_admin` block — it does NOT redefine `id`, `name`, `title`, etc.
 * Future field additions to the public schema flow through automatically;
 * drift is structurally impossible.
 *
 * Source story: docs/user-stories/as-business-admin/forms/forms-list.md
 *
 * @see ADR-012 D2, D3, D9 — locked by story #3, consumed here
 * @see plan §4.4 — per-story design for US-ADMIN-FORMS-LIST
 * @see plan §3.5 — helper API additivity-only across stories #3–#7
 * @see plan §6.5 — schema reuse rule (extend, never duplicate)

 * any Phase-0 admin list endpoint — runs-list uses structured filters
 * (`?status`, `?automationName`); this story exercises the helper's
 * ability to accept arbitrary Zod-shaped filter fields.
 *
 * **Default `include_deleted=false`** is the D2 consumption. Forms cannot
 * be soft-deleted in Phase 0; the parameter parses without 400 (forward
 * contract — same shape as runs-list). The Zod `.default(false)` is
 * applied at the schema layer so handlers never see `undefined`.
 *

 * stringly-typed with coercion) so loaders can consume the parsed value

/**
 * Single admin form item — public `formSummarySchema` extended with the

 *
 * The order of `.extend()` matters for OpenAPI naming: the resulting
 * schema is registered under `FormAdminItem` so client SDKs generate a
 * type that says "this is a form summary with admin extras", not just
 * "extended FormSummary". The canonical fields (`id`, `name`, `title`,
 * `path`, `accessLevel`, `isOpen`) are inherited verbatim from the public
 * `formSummarySchema`; the only addition is the `_admin` block.
 *
 * **`_admin.metadata` populated for forms** — first Phase-0 consumer to
 * surface domain-specific extras under the optional metadata slot. Per
 * the D3 lock from runs-list, the canonical block stays stable; only
 * `metadata` flows through new domain-specific fields. The runtime
 * handler populates `metadata` with:
 *
 *   - `fieldCount` (non-negative int) — `app.forms[].fields.length`
 *   - `submissionCount` (non-negative int) — `count(*)` over
 *     `form_submissions` filtered by `form_name = items[].name`
 *   - `lastSubmissionAt` (ISO 8601 datetime / null) — `max(submitted_at)`
 *     over the same join; null when the form has never received a
 *     submission
 *
 * The wire-format `_admin.metadata` is `Record<string, unknown> |
 * undefined` per the canonical envelope; the loader narrows the
 * `unknown` values at construction time. Specs can spot-check the keys
 * without depending on the metadata's full shape (the canonical block is
 * the only D3-locked surface).
