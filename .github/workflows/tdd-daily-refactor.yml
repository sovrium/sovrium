name: TDD Queue - Daily Refactor

# Purpose: Automated daily codebase refactoring
# - Waits for TDD queue to become clean (no in-progress specs, no open PRs)
# - Runs codebase-refactor-auditor agent
# - Creates PR with auto-merge enabled
# - Monday-Saturday: Incremental (last 24h changes)
# - Sunday: Full codebase audit

on:
  # Scheduled runs - Daily at 2:00 AM UTC (runs before populate to refactor on clean queue)
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * *'

  # Manual trigger for testing

            **Scope**: ${{ needs.wait-for-clean.outputs.scope_description }}


            **Instructions**:

            1. Run @agent-codebase-refactor-auditor in automated mode

            2. Apply Phase 1.1 refactors immediately (safe, automated changes only)

            3. Skip Phase 1.2 recommendations (require manual approval)

            4. Run quality checks: bun run quality

            5. Commit changes with message: "refactor: automated ${{ needs.wait-for-clean.outputs.scope }} maintenance"

            6. Create PR to main with label "automated-refactor"

            7. Enable auto-merge: gh pr merge --auto --squash


            **Important**: This is FULLY AUTOMATED - no human approval needed if tests pass.

            Only apply safe refactors that maintain test coverage and pass all quality gates.

          This PR was created by the daily automated refactoring workflow but failed quality checks.

          **Next Steps**:
          1. Review the failed checks in the PR
          2. Fix issues manually if needed
          3. Push fixes to this branch
          4. Remove draft status and re-enable auto-merge when ready

          The TDD queue will resume normal operation regardless of this failure.
